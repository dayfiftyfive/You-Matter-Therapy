                This may be the time in your life that you are struggling to cope with overwhelming challenges—whether that is sadness, anxiety, grieving for a loved one, intrusive thoughts, or emotional dysregulation. You may be feeling trapped and frustrated, unable to find a way to turn off the whirlwind of thoughts flooding through your mind.

            <p class="overview__text">
                Now that I have your attention, take a moment to breathe, look around you, and name one thing that you are grateful for in this moment even if you have had a bad day—it can be as simple as “I got through a very bad day today.” 
            </p>
            
            <p class="overview__text">
                My goal is to equip you with a plethora of tools to help manage the life-changing struggles. These tools may include coping strategies, improving social skills, managing intrusive thoughts, emotional regulation, or conflict resolution. I am passionate about helping you live up to your full potential. You matter.

                Now that I have your attention, I would like you to ask yourself: As you scroll through your social media, what do you see? When I scroll through mine, I now see a world that is filled with picture-perfect posts, making us more self-conscious and keeping us from leading an authentic life. And when we lack authenticity, it keeps us from acknowledging our own vulnerability, thereby preventing us from asking for help. This is the best time to acknowledge that you need help, and I am here to help you make peace with your thoughts through counseling and self-compassion.

                I offer individual, couples, and family therapy.

            <p class="overview__text">
                Hello and Welcome! My name is Numra Yaqub. I am originally from New Jersey, where I obtained my Bachelor’s in Psychology at Stockton University. I then moved to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania to obtain my Master’s degree in Counseling and Human Services at Lehigh University. During my time in the Lehigh Valley area, I worked at an inpatient psychiatric facility, where I began to gain experience in working with children, adolescents, and adults with a mental health diagnosis. During that time, I also completed my internship at Kutztown University, providing counseling services to college students.
            </p>
            
            <p class="overview__text">
                Upon graduating from Lehigh University in 2016, I made a cross-country trip to Florida to begin my career as a Master-level mental health professional. Since then, I have continued to grow, and my resume is colored with a wide range of jobs—from working with children and adolescents, to university students at the University of South Florida’s Counseling Center, and now I have transitioned into my private practice in Fort Myers.
