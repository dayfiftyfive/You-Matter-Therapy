                <p class="overview__text">
                    Hello and Welcome! My name is Numra Yaqub. I am originally from New Jersey, where I obtained my Bachelor’s in Psychology at Stockton University. I then moved to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania to obtain my Master’s degree in Counseling and Human Services at Lehigh University. During my time in the Lehigh Valley area, I worked at an inpatient psychiatric facility, where I began to gain experience in working with children, adolescents, and adults with a mental health diagnosis. During that time, I also completed my internship at Kutztown University, providing counseling services to college students.

                <p class="overview__text">
                    Upon graduating from Lehigh University in 2016, I made a cross-country trip to Florida to begin my career as a Master-level mental health professional. Since then, I have continued to grow, and my resume is colored with a wide range of jobs—from working with children and adolescents, to university students at the University of South Florida’s Counseling Center, and now I have transitioned into my private practice in Fort Myers. 
                </p>
                
                <p class="overview__text">
                    I look forward to helping you work towards the fulfillment and balance you deserve.
                </p>
